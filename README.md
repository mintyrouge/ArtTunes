# ArtTunes

***Hackathon Submission for ShellHacks 2020***

## Inspiration
Grace came up with the idea when contemplating the fact that so many people are not able to appreciate art through the sense of sight.

## What it does
The Art Tunes web app receives a user's image and converts the image to sound so that those who are blind can experience art and paintings through sound.

## How we built it
For the development of the app, we used MarvinJ and Image-Parser to create the outlines of the image and parse the image to read columns of pixels at a time, from left to right using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also, we used bootstrap for the stylizing of the web app and VS Code, Github, and Repl.it to share and edit code simultaneously.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the hardest challenges we faced during the project was sending our converted image to the image-parser to read the pixels.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the time we spent together working on this project and all of the things we learned along the way.

## What we learned
We learned how to use bootstrap, incorporate javascript libraries, and utilize netlify to host our web app.

## What's next for Art Tunes
We would like to further the project by making it a mobile app to also add the capability of haptic vibrations, in sync with the sound of the image, so that art can be experienced by a wider range of people with disabilities, both blind and deaf.
